# WhatsApp Data Extractor 

<!-- Include Github badges here (optional) -->
<!-- e.g. Github Actions workflow status -->

In collaboration with the [Human Data Science group](https://hds.sites.uu.nl) and [Eyra](https://eyra.co), we developed scripts
to make WhatsApp data packages easily accessible to researchers. 

The main goal is that respondents can voluntarily donate their data 
download packages through an online platform (PORT), and researchers can provide custom data extraction scripts, which will be run locally on the respondentâ€™s devices. 
The [port-poc](https://github.com/eyra/port-poc) has been developed by Eyra, while WhatsApp data extraction scripts were provided by the Soda team.

This project consists of two main scripts for extracting information from WhatsApp group chats and WhatsApp account data.

##Todo how to download data download package from whatsapp?
Whatsapp data packages can be requested via the whatsapp account ...
## How it works
The extraction logic is placed in the process function within data_extractor/[whatsapp_chat or whatsapp_account_info]/__init__.py which follows the template format of PORT.

The main function in these scripts is process() which takes .txt and .zip files as input.


## Usage

<!-- We should add here -->
- Install Poetry:
```pip install poetry
```
- install the required python packages :
``` poetry install
```

The behavior of the process function can be verified by running the tests. The test are located in the tests folder.
To run the tests
```
poetry run pytest
```

To extract data from Whatsapp data packages from the browser run the following code from the project root folder (the one with .git):

```
python3 -m http.server
```

This will start a webserver on: localhost. Opening a browser with that URL will initialize the application. After it has been loaded a file can be selected. The output of the process function will be displayed after a while (depending on the amount of processing required and the speed of the machine)

Data is processed locally. 
Security is preserved.

In case of agreement, donator can donate the extracted information
