# WhatsApp Data Extractor 

<!-- Include Github badges here (optional) -->
<!-- e.g. Github Actions workflow status -->

In collaboration with the [Human Data Science group](https://hds.sites.uu.nl) and [Eyra](https://eyra.co), we developed scripts
to make WhatsApp data packages easily accessible to researchers. 

Respondents can voluntarily donate their data 
download packages through an online platform (PORT), and researchers can provide custom data extraction scripts, which will be run locally on the respondentâ€™s devices. 
The [port-poc](https://github.com/eyra/port-poc) has been developed by Eyra, while WhatsApp data extraction scripts were provided by the Soda team.

This project consists of two main scripts for extracting information from WhatsApp group chats and WhatsApp account data.
